 I have a strong foundation in programming languages such as SQL, Java, Javascript, Python, PHP, C, and C++. I also have experience working with databases such as MySQL and Oracle. In addition, you have knowledge of web development frameworks like Django. These skills make me a well-rounded and competent developer, capable of building a wide range of software applications. With this skill set, I would be able to work on projects involving data management, backend development, and web development

Skills: C / C++ / PYTHON / JAVA / JAVASCRIPT / PHP / SQL / DJANGO / JS / HTML / CSS
